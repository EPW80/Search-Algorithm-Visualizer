# Search Algorithm Visualizer

The Search Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to help users understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms. The tool provides a graphical representation of algorithms like Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Best First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search. Users can interactively place start and end nodes, add walls, and observe how different algorithms find the path between the nodes.

## Features

- Interactive Grid: Users can click and drag on the grid to create walls, place start and end nodes, and define paths.
- Algorithm Selection: Choose from a variety of algorithms to visualize their pathfinding process.
- Responsive Design: The application is responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes.
- Control Options: Includes options to reset the grid, adjust the speed of the visualization, and select different mazes and patterns.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- CSS: Styling for the visual elements of the application.
- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the content.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the backend (if applicable).
- Webpack: Module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
